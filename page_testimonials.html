              As a member of Angie's List, I highly recommend Narron Fence to anyone residing in the Midlothian area of Virginia.
              Narron Fence has been in business for a long time and after dealing with them, I know why.Penny Narron is dedicated to her business and it shows.
              She is always available by phone or e-mail and responds quickly.You can expect her to be on time and provide an estimate on the spot.Penny is very knowledgeable and honest. I did not want to spend more money than I needed to and I suggested something that she said would look tacky and her company does not do tacky and she was right.
              We have a huge rock on our property line that my wife loves and they built the fence over it so it would remain exposed.
              The installers were very professional and addressed any questions or concerns I had.
              We are very pleased with the job.<br><br>

              Thank you for a beautiful job on our new vinyl fence. It certainly enhances the
              curb appeal of our home.<br><br>
              The fence installers you sent did a wonderful job. Working all weekend to
              complete the project on time. The job they did was so professional and they were
              always courteous, neat and careful with our property. They were amazingly fast
              and efficient!<br><br>
              I would recommend Narron Fences without hesitation.<br><br>
              Again, thank you for a beautiful fence and a professional job.<br><br>

              Hi Penny,<br><br>
              
              I'd just like to thank you for the fine work you performed at our property in Birkdale.<br>
              The fence is attractive and well constructed, and truly an "improvement" to our lot.<br>
              The man who built the fence did so with precision and obvious skill. The fence is straight and the gates blend in so well you hardly know they are there.<br>
              This is our third fence and it's definitely the most attractive and best built. In addition to building a good fence, you and your carpenter have been very pleasent to do business with.<br>
              We especially appreciate your willingness to build between and around existing trees.<br><br>
              
              Thanks for a good job!<br><br>
              
              -Jennifer Jessen<br><br>
              
              P.S. Too bad we won't need to do business with you again (unless, of course, we move)!

              I just wanted to take a moment to compliment your workers on a job well done. They worked so hard last Monday and Tuesday to get out my old fence and put in the new one; the results are astounding! I have received so many compliments.<br>

              Dear Ms. Narron:<br><br>
              
              I just wanted to send a quick note to tell you how much we love our new 6' tall board fence!<br>
              
              This is the second project you've done for us, and we wouldn't hire anyone else. Your estimates are prompt and reasonable, the materials you use are superior to those used by other fencing companies, your workers construct what we've envisioned (if not better!), and they do a very nice job cleaning up the site.<br>
              
              We will always recommend Narron Fence to our friends, neighbors and co-workers.<br>

              Penny,<br><br>
              I wanted to thank you and your staff for doing such a great job building my fence. I am sorry there was a problem at first with the Homeowner's Association, but you and your builders displayed a high degree of professionalism in dealing with the conflict.<br>
              It has been such a pleasant experience working with you and your staff.<br>
              My wife and I love our fence, and it has added so much to the appearance of our home.<br>
              Not only does the fence look wonderful, but it was your expert advice that helped us decide what would look best.<br>
              I can't wait to recommend you to anyone I know who needs to build a fence.<br>
              I hope you find much success in the New Year.<br><br>
